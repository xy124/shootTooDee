shootTooDee
===========

a simple 2D shooter which was written for a local game jam facing "2d-Shooter with highly scriptable weapons" as subject


Unfortunately five hours of time didn't allow me to generate a real scriptengine. 
Nevertheless there is a trajectories array in src/player.js where new "weapons" could be added easily.

to test open
	http://xy124.github.io/shootTooDee/index.html

controls are:

	player1:
		move : up, down, left, right
		shoot: NumBlock0
	player2:
		move : w, a, s, d
		shoot: f

As code was created in the hurry of a gamejam documentation was neclected. Nevertheless I plan to add some more features 
that will get better documented.
